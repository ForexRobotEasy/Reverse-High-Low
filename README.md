# Reverse High Low Trading Robot

This is a code for a trading robot that utilizes an advanced oscillator algorithm to determine optimal reversal times in the foreign exchange market. The robot is designed to open buy trades with three different take profit levels when it identifies an optimal reversal time.

## How it Works

The code starts by including necessary libraries and defining constants. It then initializes objects for trading and the oscillator. 

The `calculateTakeProfit` function is used to calculate the three take profit levels based on the current market information and the defined TP values.

The `isOptimalReversalTime` function implements the algorithm to determine if the current time is an optimal reversal time. The algorithm uses the oscillator value to make this determination. The specific logic for the algorithm is not provided in the code and should be added by the user.

The `executeTradingStrategy` function executes the trading strategy. It first calls the `calculateTakeProfit` function to get the take profit levels. It then checks if it is an optimal reversal time by calling the `isOptimalReversalTime` function. If it is, the function opens three buy trades with different trade sizes and the calculated take profit levels.

The `OnTick` function is the entry point of the trading robot. It calls the `executeTradingStrategy` function on each tick.

The `OnStart` function drives the entire code development process. It includes functions to test the code, ensure code standards, provide instructions, integrate the code, and provide support during deployment.
